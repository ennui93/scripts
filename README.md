# scripts
A collection of scripts I've written to simplify some tasks, grouped by language/specification.

## posix
\*nix/*BSD/POSIX/"bash" shell scripts, which I've done my best to write in compliance with [POSIX.1-2008](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/), meaning they should be fairly portable.

## ps1
PowerShell scripts.
